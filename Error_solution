You can encounter this kind of error while doing this project  “To authenticate with the Hugging Face Hub, 
create a token in your settings tab (https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), set it as secret in your Google Colab and restart your session.”
Here is the solution for this:


Create the Token in Hugging Face:
Go to Hugging Face Settings.
Create a new token.


Open Google Colab:
Open a new or existing Colab notebook.


Mount Google Drive:
Run the following code to mount Google Drive:
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')


Create the Directory and Token File:
Run the following code to create the directory and token file:
!mkdir -p '/content/drive/MyDrive/.huggingface/'
# Replace 'your_hugging_face_token_here' with the actual token
echo "huggingface.co:\n  token: your_hugging_face_token_here" > '/content/drive/MyDrive/.huggingface/token.yaml'
Make sure to replace 'your_hugging_face_token_here' with the actual token.


Set the Environment Variable:
Run the following code to set the environment variable:
%env HF_HOME=/content/drive/MyDrive/.huggingface


Restart the Runtime:
Go to the "Runtime" menu, select "Restart runtime," and confirm.


Reuse the Secret Token:
In any Colab notebook, you can reuse the secret token by running the following code:
from google.colab import auth
auth.authenticate_user()
%env HF_HOME=/content/drive/MyDrive/.huggingface

Ensure that you have the correct token and that the directory and file are created successfully. 
If you encounter any issues, double-check the paths and make sure you follow the steps accurately.
